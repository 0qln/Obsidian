I was planning on making a bot, then I had some medical complications, but I think it still might be a cool and pretty simple idea if anyone else wants to try it out.

under genetic algorithms (GAs, like NEAT or NSGA II), there are methods of training a network to encode the weights of ANNs through a calculation (its called indirect encoding, for ex HyperNEAT-LEO). This means that you can store a way to calculate all of the weights & biases in the network, with another smaller network.

specifically given the limited token count, its possible to encode pretty large ANNs into your chess bot, which even if it doesn't work the best, could be interesting to see.

anyways, random comments over, gl to everyone participating!

MSS, builds off of HyperNEAT

CMOEA, builds off of MSS, a little complicated but could work better
